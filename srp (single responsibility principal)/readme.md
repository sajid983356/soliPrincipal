The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is one of the key principles of object-oriented design and software development. It states that a class, module, or function should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility or job.

When to Consider Using SRP
Here are scenarios where you should consider applying the Single Responsibility Principle:

1. When a Class or Function is Doing Too Much
Scenario: You have a class or function that handles multiple tasks or concerns, such as handling both business logic and data persistence, or managing user input and formatting output.
Consider SRP: Break down the class or function into smaller, more focused units, each handling a single responsibility.
Example: Notification Service (sending email, sending sms, format message, savingMessage)

If you have a UserService class that both validates user input and interacts with the database, consider separating this into a UserValidator class for validation and a UserRepository class for database interactions.

2. When You Encounter Code That’s Hard to Understand
Scenario: You come across a large class or method that’s difficult to read, understand, or reason about because it handles multiple concerns.
Consider SRP: Refactor the code into smaller, more focused classes or methods that each address a single concern, making the code easier to read and maintain.
Example:

A method called processOrder() might handle order validation, inventory checks, payment processing, and sending notifications. This should be broken down into multiple methods or classes, each responsible for one aspect of the order processing.
3. When a Class or Function Has Multiple Reasons to Change
Scenario: You notice that a class or function is likely to change for different reasons, such as changing business rules, UI updates, or data structure modifications.
Consider SRP: Separate concerns into different classes or functions so that each one has only one reason to change.
Example:

A ReportGenerator class might handle both the generation of report data and its formatting. If the report format or data structure changes, both concerns would lead to modifications in this class. Instead, separate the data generation and formatting into different classes.
4. When Unit Testing Becomes Difficult
Scenario: Writing unit tests for a class or function is challenging because it has too many responsibilities, leading to complex test setups and assertions.
Consider SRP: Simplify the class or function by breaking it into smaller units with single responsibilities. This makes each unit easier to test independently.
Example:

If a method both fetches data from an API and processes that data, testing it would require mocking the API and verifying the processing logic. Splitting these concerns into separate methods or classes allows for more focused and easier-to-write tests.
5. When You Notice High Coupling and Low Cohesion
Scenario: A class or module has many dependencies (high coupling) and performs unrelated tasks, leading to low cohesion.
Consider SRP: Refactor the class or module to increase cohesion by grouping related tasks together and separating unrelated ones.
Example:

A CustomerAccountManager class that handles everything from customer registration to account deletion and sending promotional emails has low cohesion. Instead, create separate classes like CustomerRegistrar, AccountDeleter, and PromotionalEmailSender.
6. When Maintaining or Updating Code is Risky
Scenario: Every time you change a piece of code, you worry about breaking other unrelated functionality because the code is handling multiple responsibilities.
Consider SRP: Isolate responsibilities into different units so that changes to one responsibility don’t affect others, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.
Example:

If a NotificationService class is responsible for sending emails, logging events, and updating the user interface, any change in one area could break the others. Separate these concerns into dedicated services for each task.
7. During Initial Design and Architecture
Scenario: You’re designing a new system or module from scratch and want to ensure it’s maintainable, scalable, and easy to understand.
Consider SRP: Design classes, modules, and functions with a single responsibility in mind from the beginning. This approach leads to a clean, well-architected system.
Example:

When designing a content management system (CMS), create separate services for content creation, content storage, and content delivery rather than having a single service that tries to handle all aspects of content management.
Summary
You should consider using the Single Responsibility Principle whenever:

A class or function is doing too much or has multiple responsibilities.
Code becomes hard to understand, maintain, or test.
A class or function has multiple reasons to change.
You notice high coupling and low cohesion.
You want to reduce the risk of introducing bugs when updating or maintaining code.
You’re designing a new system or module and want to ensure a clean and scalable architecture.
By applying SRP, you create code that is easier to understand, test, maintain, and extend, leading to a more robust and flexible system overall.
